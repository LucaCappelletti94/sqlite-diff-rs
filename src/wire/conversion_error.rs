//! [`ConversionError`]: shared failure mode for digesting a CDC wire
//! event (`pg_walstream`, `wal2json`, `maxwell`) into a diff builder.
//!
//! The three forward sources previously each defined a near-identical
//! copy of this enum. They now share this one type and re-export it, so
//! the shared build helpers in [`shared_builders`](super::shared_builders)
//! return a single error type across every source.
